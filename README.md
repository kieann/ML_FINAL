This is the final project of the course machine learning where we would try to predict the outcome of failure of product based on real life data. Requirements for running this code.

1. Download the code and data from this repository.
2. Download the requirements.txt and intall the needed dependencies to run this code.
3. Can chose to either train the model or to use a pre-trained model.
4. To train the model yourself download both train.py and inference.py.
5. To use the pre-trained model download inference.py and model.bin.
